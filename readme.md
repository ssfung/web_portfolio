# Man Suet Fung Web Portfolio Project

Website: https://ssfung.netlify.com/

Github: https://github.com/ssfung/web_portfolio


# Purpose
The purpose of the web portfolio was a means to showcase my skills, work experience and hobbies to potential employers or potential work partners. It also contains a way to reach out to me through the contact page or get to further know me as an individual through my linkedin, resume and github links. 

This website was also a means to showcase my HTML and CSS skills to the user. 

# Functionality & Functionality 

1. **Navbar** 

A fixed navbar on the top ensures it is easy for the user to get around the page and know what pages are available on my website. This was placed consistently throughout the pages to ensure easy navigation around the website. 

2. **Scroll down layout**

A single page scrolling layout was chosen for easy viewing, similar to scrolling on an Instagram feed. 

3. **Resume**

A link placed at the start of the homepage was added to ensure that a potential employer can access it immediately and download a copy onto their local computer. 

4. **Responsiveness**

The portfolio can be viewed easily on a desktop and is designed to be viewed on mobile device as well. This ensures that a wide audience is able to view this website.  

5. **Design**

A minimal design was used this website to ensure that the user can find the information they are looking for easily. 

The color design of soft pinks/white/grey is complimented by black and grey color font. Times New Roman was selected for its classic and classy design.  

Links were consistently underlined in the homepage for easy navigation. 


6. **Subresource Integrity**

Subresource Integrity has been added onto the website to ensure that no malicious code by an external party has been added to the website since its deployment.
